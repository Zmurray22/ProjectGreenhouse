Plant Management passion project

Give your plants a brain! Plant management for everyone

Project Greenhouse is a plant management tool that remembers what they need, so you can focus on other things.

**Plant recognition API**
Take a picture and find out what species it is, along with toxicity report, care needs, etc. Then import it all into a plant profile. There are lots of reasons to understand a plant before you buy. Having that data quickly can improve the chances that the plants you buy will thrive.

**Plant Profiles and Groups**
Each plant is unique. To accurately track growth, health concerns, and other historical data, each plant should have a profile with a full suite of information at hand. You can give it a thumbnail to recognize one plant from another, take and store a history of pictures for tracking changes over time, and post that entire profile on the community page.

**Auto scheduling for care based on weather forecast and historical data**
It's not enough to get a last minute warning that dangerous weather is going to destroy your outdoor plants. Having advanced warning of a storm approaching in a couple of days gives you time to prepare. But this feature is just as applicable to plants indoors. Some plants dry out faster than others. You can note this information over time and let the scheduler adjust your watering routines. 

**Advanced search and grouping features**
When you have a lot of plants, it's convenient to have several options for searching through the list. We also want to be able to group plants, whether by location, species, care type, etc. Each plant listing also displays status symbols for watering level, health, toxicity, and other optional factors.

**Mapping and diagram builder**
If you have more than a handful of plants, it's likely that they are placed in several locations to take advantage of the sunlight. Store and manage layouts for gardens and locations.
